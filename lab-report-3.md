# Lab Report 3

## Part 1 - Bugs
The bug I chose from lab 4 is the bug in the following function.

```
  static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
  }
```

A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, as a JUnit test and any associated code is ```int[] inputArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};```

An input that doesnâ€™t induce a failure, as a JUnit test and any associated code ```int[] inputArray = {3, 3, 3, 3, 3}; ```

The symptom, as the output of running the tests (provide it as a screenshot of running JUnit with at least the two inputs above) 

The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it 
``` ```
Briefly describe why the fix addresses the issue.
